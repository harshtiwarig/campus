P-1

🚀 Overview

Campus Sigma is a next-generation Campus Operating System designed to eliminate the messy fragmentation in college life.
Instead of checking WhatsApp groups, random Google Forms, siloed university portals, and physical notice boards, students get ONE unified platform for everything.

This project was built during a 24-hour Hackathon, focusing on real-world impact, scalability, and fast execution.

Our core aim was simple:

“Make campus life smarter, faster, more connected — all in one place.”

🎯 Hackathon Problem Statement (Simplified)

Modern campuses suffer from fragmented resources, poor communication flow, and lack of centralized systems, resulting in missed opportunities and low engagement.
The task was to develop a unified platform supporting students, faculty, and admins, providing:

Real-time information

Easy collaboration

Smart resource optimization

Simplified event & academic management

Gamification to reward active participation
